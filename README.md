## ‚ùì Why the application was created

The extension was created because a friend's organization provides voluntary web seminars for old people. The organization needs to prove this to the sponsors. It's a German organization. This is why the first version was written in German, too.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- This extension only works on https://meet.jit.si right now. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/Robert-Beier/jitsi-speaker-stats-exporter/issues/5) for detecting a jitsi application independent from the domain.
- Currently, the extension is only available in German üá©üá™ translation. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/Robert-Beier/jitsi-speaker-stats-exporter/issues/3) for adding localization.
